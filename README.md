## Innovation Feature

The key innovation in this project is the **dynamic project management system**:

- Users can display real projects instead of static dummy data.
- Projects are rendered dynamically using React state.
- Each project includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tech stack badges
  - Image preview

Additionally:
- AI-powered bio generation simulates intelligent content creation.
- Smooth animations enhance user experience using Framer Motion.

This makes the portfolio more interactive and scalable compared to traditional static portfolios.
